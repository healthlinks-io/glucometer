##Glucometer UI Code
This is the code for the user interface of a glucose meter I am building.  It requires python 2.7, [kivy](https://kivy.org/#home), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org), [kivy-garden graph](https://github.com/kivy-garden/garden.graph), circularlayout, circular datetime picker, matplotlib, [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org), matplotlib (from pip), and pyjnius.
Note that the project page in on [hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/12778-raspberry-pi-glucometer), this is simply the code.
